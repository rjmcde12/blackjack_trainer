This tool is for learning the correct/book moves at the Blackjack table in order to reduce the house edge as much as possible. It purposefully does not deal out additional cards nor show the dealers hole card. This is done to create an environment where you are giving quick and direct feedback on your decision whether it is correct or incorrect *based on the book play* and not confuse your mind with seeing the result of the hand that may or may not turn out in your favor. Obviously, every book play does not result in a win, but it does give you the best long run odds. Ignoring the actual outcome and only focusing on grading the proper play is the best way to train your mind.

The theory behind this is explained well in *Incognito* by David Eagleman and *Think Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. A brief summary with the example used by David Eagleman can be found here: https://commoncog.com/chicken-sexing-and-perceptual-learning-as-a-path-to-expertise/

Future Updates:
Working on adding a stat tracker to log your success/failure rate and highlight what hands are continuing to give you trouble.
